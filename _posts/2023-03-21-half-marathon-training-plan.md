I'm running the [2023 Knynsa Forest half marathon](https://knysnaforestmarathon.co.za/) ([archive](https://archive.ph/Dk0gc)) this year.
This is my first ever half-marathon, so I want to document my training for it.

The following table shows the training plan I'll be following.
It's a modified version of [Hal Higdon's Novice 2 Half Marathon training schedule](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/half-marathon-training/novice-2-half-marathon/) ([archive](https://archive.ph/8PqiF)).
I've modified Hal's schedule by lengthing it to 16 weeks and making the distances more metric-friendly.

| Week | Monday | Tuesday             | Wednesday           | Thursday            | Friday | Saturday              | Sunday                      |

## Diary

### 2023-03-26

First cross training day.
We took advantage of a Kayaking voucher I was given for my birthday.
Usually, the trip is scheduled to last 2 hours but wind and a bit of rain made our guides decide to turn around early.
Really good experience regardless.
See [Cape Kayak Adventures](https://kayak.co.za/) ([archive](https://archive.ph/DdZzk)) for more.

### 2023-03-25

This week's "long run".
Drizzly, cold and wonderful.
Overshot the 6.5 km planned distance but that's okay.

![Strava image. Distance: 7.0 km, Pace: 7:10 /km, Time: 50m 22s]({{ "/assets/2023-03-21-diary-2023-03-25.jpg" | relative_url }})

### 2023-03-23

Quite a tough one today.
The Molteno Dam, featured in [2023-03-21](#2023-03-21)'s entry, doesn't open at lunch time.
So we had to do zig-zags up the mountain to make distance.

![Strava image. Distance: 5.2 km, Elev Gain: 165 m, Time: 47m 55s]({{ "/assets/2023-03-21-diary-2023-03-23.jpg" | relative_url }})

### 2023-03-22

Treadmill this morning so no Strava image.
My watch (Garmin Forerunner 245), needed a bit of calibration to get its accuracy right.
No GPS means it's doing a lot of guesswork.

- Treadmill distance: 5.0 km
- Watch distance: 4.3 km

It's a pity that you can't calibrate the watch _before_ it sends everything to Strava.
But I guess that'll mess up all of Strava's analyses since it won't know where to add the distance delta.
Like should it smear the distance over the complete activity or maybe just add it on at the end?

### 2023-03-21

Day 1!
I almost forgot to run today.
It was a relatively easy one.
Just up to the Molteno reservoir and around a few times.
I'm not planning to slow down my Brazilian Jiu-jitsu training during this half-marathon prep so it'll be interesting to see how one affects the other.
BJJ is always on Monday and Wednesday evenings.
