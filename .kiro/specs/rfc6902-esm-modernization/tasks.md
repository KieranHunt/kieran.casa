  - Ensure import map structure remains unchanged for backward compatibility
  - Test dependency resolution in both development and production modes
  - _Requirements: 2.4, 5.4_

- [x] 4. Test basic JSX compilation and component rendering

  - Verify that the JsonPatchGenerator component compiles without errors
  - Test that React components render correctly in the browser

  - Validate that all React hooks and state management work as expected
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 2.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [ ] 5. Validate core JSON patch generation functionality

  - Test JSON input parsing for both "Before" and "After" fields
  - Verify that patch generation produces correct RFC6902 patches
  - Test enhanced patch creation with previousValue and removedValue
  - Validate automatic patch generation with 300ms debounce
  - Test edge cases like empty inputs, invalid JSON, and identical objects
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 4.5_

- [ ] 6. Test user interface and interaction features

  - Verify that enhanced patch operations display correctly (ADD, REMOVE, REPLACE)
  - Test visual indicators and styling for different operation types
  - Validate side-by-side display of previous and new values for REPLACE operations
  - Test copy-to-clipboard functionality and visual feedback
  - Verify error message display for JSON parsing errors
  - Test "No differences found" message display
  - _Requirements: 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12_

- [ ] 7. Implement comprehensive error handling

  - Test error handling for JSX compilation failures
  - Verify graceful handling of network issues with esm.sh
  - Test error boundaries around patch generation logic
  - Validate error message display and user feedback
  - Test recovery from error states
  - _Requirements: 3.11, 4.6_

- [ ] 8. Create and run comprehensive test suite

  - Write test cases for JSX compilation with esm.sh/tsx
  - Create tests for all React component rendering scenarios
  - Implement tests for JSON patch generation accuracy
  - Write tests for user interaction workflows
  - Create tests for error handling and edge cases
  - Test copy-to-clipboard functionality across browsers
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.7, 4.8_

- [x] 9. Performance testing and optimization

  - Measure and document new bundle size compared to Babel version
  - Test page load times and compare with baseline metrics
  - Verify JSX compilation speed and caching behavior
  - Test performance across different browsers and devices
  - Document performance improvements achieved
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 5.6_

- [ ] 10. Cross-browser and environment testing

  - Test functionality in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
  - Verify compatibility with Jekyll development server (localhost)
  - Test production deployment behavior
  - Validate esm.sh/tsx development mode features on localhost
  - Test production mode caching and performance
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_

- [ ] 11. Integration testing with Jekyll environment

  - Verify that the tool works correctly when served by Jekyll
  - Test integration with existing blog infrastructure
  - Validate that esm.sh/tsx script loads and executes in Jekyll context
  - Test both development and production Jekyll environments
  - Ensure no conflicts with other Jekyll plugins or scripts
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_

- [ ] 12. Final validation and documentation
  - Run complete test suite to ensure all functionality works
  - Validate that all requirements have been met
  - Document any changes or considerations for future maintenance
  - Create rollback plan in case issues are discovered
  - Verify that the tool maintains exact same user experience
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 3.1-3.12, 4.1-4.8_
