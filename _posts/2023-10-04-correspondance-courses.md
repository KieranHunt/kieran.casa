Back in early high school I read Anne Frank's novel, _Diary of a Young Girl_.
In it she describes learning all sorts of things through correspondence courses: shorthand, English, French, Dutch, and Latin. Of course, remote learning was pretty much her only option.

I loved the idea of _sending off_ for a course and getting a whad of material back.
I could work through it at my own pace.
Deep learning.

Now when I look at my Udemy account I see two unstarted courses and one 25% complete.
What's my excuse?
