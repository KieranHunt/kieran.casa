## Research

The whole internet exists! Use #[playwrite] browser_navigate to go and do research before you start.
It's probably good to start at https://duckduckgo.com/ and then navigate from there.
Use this to learn about topics, libraries and techniques.
Feel free to search for any problems you're having.

## Testing your work

If you want to see what a page looks like, load it up in a web browser.
Use #[playwrite] browser_navigate to open the page in a real browser.

Don't open the page directly, instead navigate to the Jekyll-hosted version.
Check if Jekyll is already running (use `ps aux | grep jekyll`). The ps command will also reveal the port its running on.

## Styling

Never use custom styles. Always use Tailwind classes.
