# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature creates a web-based tool that allows users to input text and automatically insert a selected emoji between each word, creating a delimited text output. The tool should provide an intuitive interface for text input, emoji selection, and easy copying of the formatted result. This expands on the popular "clapping hands" meme format to work with any emoji the user chooses.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to input text into a text area, so that I can prepare content for emoji delimitation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL display a prominent text input area
2. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL automatically focus the text input area for immediate typing
3. WHEN I type in the text area THEN the system SHALL accept and display my input in real-time
4. WHEN the text area is empty THEN the system SHALL show placeholder text indicating what to enter
5. WHEN I enter multi-line text THEN the system SHALL preserve line breaks in the output

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select from a variety of emojis, so that I can choose which emoji will delimit my text.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL display a selection of popular emojis for quick access
2. WHEN I click on an emoji THEN the system SHALL select it as the active delimiter
3. WHEN an emoji is selected THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback showing which emoji is active
4. WHEN I want more emoji options THEN the system SHALL provide access to a broader emoji picker
5. WHEN no emoji is selected THEN the system SHALL default to a commonly used emoji (like clapping hands)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a live preview of my delimited text, so that I can verify the output before copying.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I type text and have an emoji selected THEN the system SHALL display the delimited output in real-time
2. WHEN the input text changes THEN the system SHALL update the preview immediately
3. WHEN I change the selected emoji THEN the system SHALL update the preview with the new delimiter
4. WHEN the input is empty THEN the system SHALL show an example or placeholder in the preview area
5. WHEN text contains multiple spaces THEN the system SHALL treat consecutive spaces as single word separators

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to easily copy the formatted text, so that I can paste it into social media or messaging apps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN delimited text is generated THEN the system SHALL display a prominent "Copy" button
2. WHEN I click the copy button THEN the system SHALL copy the delimited text to my clipboard
3. WHEN text is successfully copied THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback confirming the action
4. WHEN the copy action fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and provide alternative copy methods
5. WHEN there is no text to copy THEN the system SHALL disable or hide the copy button

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the tool to work well on both desktop and mobile devices, so that I can use it anywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the tool on mobile THEN the system SHALL display a responsive layout optimized for touch interaction
2. WHEN I access the tool on desktop THEN the system SHALL utilize available screen space effectively
3. WHEN using touch devices THEN the system SHALL provide appropriately sized touch targets for emoji selection
4. WHEN the screen size changes THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout accordingly
5. WHEN using the tool on any device THEN the system SHALL maintain full functionality across all features

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the tool to handle edge cases gracefully, so that I get predictable results regardless of my input.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I enter text with punctuation THEN the system SHALL preserve punctuation and only delimit between words
2. WHEN I enter text with numbers THEN the system SHALL treat numbers as words and delimit appropriately
3. WHEN I enter only spaces or empty text THEN the system SHALL not generate delimiter output
4. WHEN I enter very long text THEN the system SHALL handle it without performance issues
5. WHEN I enter special characters or symbols THEN the system SHALL process them as part of words where appropriate

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the tool to integrate seamlessly with the existing blog infrastructure, so that it maintains consistency and leverages existing patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tool is deployed THEN the system SHALL match the visual design and styling of the existing blog pages
2. WHEN implementing the interface THEN the system SHALL use Tailwind CSS for all styling needs
3. WHEN building interactive components THEN the system SHALL use Radix UI component library
4. WHEN structuring the application THEN the system SHALL follow the same client-rendered React pattern as RFC6902
5. WHEN loading dependencies THEN the system SHALL use esm.sh as the CDN for all external packages
6. WHEN implementing the build system THEN the system SHALL use importmaps and JSX similar to existing tools
7. WHEN integrating with the blog THEN the system SHALL follow the same file structure and naming conventions as other tools
8. WHEN deploying the tool THEN the system SHALL be placed in a folder called "everyit-zone" with the main file as "index.html"
