# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves modernizing the RFC6902 JSON Patch Generator tool by replacing the current Babel-based JSX compilation approach with esm.sh/tsx. The current implementation uses Babel standalone for client-side JSX compilation, which adds significant overhead and complexity. The new approach will leverage esm.sh/tsx, a lightweight 1KB script that sends JSX code to esm.sh servers for compilation and edge caching, eliminating the need for heavy client-side compilation libraries while maintaining the same functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the RFC6902 tool, I want the page to load faster and have better performance, so that I can generate JSON patches more efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the RFC6902 page loads THEN the initial bundle size SHALL be reduced by removing Babel standalone dependencies
2. WHEN JSX code is processed THEN it SHALL be compiled by esm.sh servers and cached at the edge instead of being compiled in the browser via Babel
3. WHEN the page is accessed THEN the loading time SHALL be improved due to reduced JavaScript bundle size and elimination of client-side compilation
4. WHEN the tool is used THEN all existing functionality SHALL remain intact and working

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the RFC6902 tool, I want to use modern ESM patterns without complex build configurations, so that the codebase is easier to maintain and update.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the implementation is updated THEN it SHALL use esm.sh/tsx for remote JSX compilation and caching
2. WHEN script tags are defined THEN they SHALL use `type="text/babel"` to maintain compatibility with esm.sh/tsx
3. WHEN the code is written THEN it SHALL remain as JSX (not converted to TSX yet)
4. WHEN dependencies are imported THEN they SHALL continue to use the existing import map structure
5. WHEN the implementation is complete THEN no local build tools SHALL be required for development or deployment

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user of the RFC6902 tool, I want all current features to work exactly the same way, so that my workflow is not disrupted by the modernization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I input JSON data in the "Before" field THEN the tool SHALL accept and process it correctly
2. WHEN I input JSON data in the "After" field THEN the tool SHALL accept and process it correctly
3. WHEN both fields contain valid JSON THEN the diff SHALL be generated automatically with a 300ms debounce
4. WHEN the diff is generated THEN it SHALL display enhanced patch operations with visual indicators (ADD, REMOVE, REPLACE)
5. WHEN a REPLACE operation is shown THEN it SHALL display both previous and new values side by side
6. WHEN an ADD operation is shown THEN it SHALL display the added value with appropriate styling
7. WHEN a REMOVE operation is shown THEN it SHALL display the removed value with appropriate styling
8. WHEN the complete patch is displayed THEN it SHALL show the raw JSON patch format
9. WHEN I click the copy button THEN the complete patch SHALL be copied to clipboard
10. WHEN the copy action is successful THEN visual feedback SHALL be provided (checkmark icon)
11. WHEN there are JSON parsing errors THEN appropriate error messages SHALL be displayed
12. WHEN there are no differences THEN a "No differences found" message SHALL be displayed

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer testing the modernized tool, I want comprehensive test coverage to ensure the migration was successful, so that I can be confident the tool works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the modernization is complete THEN comprehensive test cases SHALL be created covering all functionality
2. WHEN tests are run THEN they SHALL verify that JSX compilation works correctly with esm.sh/tsx remote compilation
3. WHEN tests are run THEN they SHALL verify that all React components render properly
4. WHEN tests are run THEN they SHALL verify that all user interactions work as expected
5. WHEN tests are run THEN they SHALL verify that JSON patch generation produces correct results
6. WHEN tests are run THEN they SHALL verify that error handling works correctly
7. WHEN tests are run THEN they SHALL verify that the copy-to-clipboard functionality works
8. WHEN tests are run THEN they SHALL verify that the visual feedback systems work correctly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to validate that the esm.sh/tsx approach works correctly in the Jekyll environment, so that the tool integrates properly with the existing blog infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page is served by Jekyll THEN the esm.sh/tsx script SHALL load and execute correctly
2. WHEN the page is accessed via localhost THEN development mode features SHALL work properly
3. WHEN the page is deployed THEN production mode SHALL work without issues
4. WHEN the import map is processed THEN all dependencies SHALL resolve correctly through esm.sh
5. WHEN the JSX code is sent to esm.sh THEN it SHALL be compiled and cached at the edge
6. WHEN subsequent page loads occur THEN cached compiled code SHALL be served for better performance
