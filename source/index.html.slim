          | I usually try to read the news from as many diverse sources as possible. To make this easy I used 
          = website_link text: 'Google News', url: 'https://news.google.com'
          |  as my primary source. Google News parses
          stories from just about every major and minor South African news outlet.

          | South African News makes use of 
          = website_link text: "CloudFlare's Workers", url: 'https://www.cloudflare.com/products/cloudflare-workers/'
          |  to quickly render the news. Data is sourced from Google News' RSS feed and injected into the page before ever
          reaching the browser. Javascript is then used to render the page once it reaches the client. Because of this
          approach, the client can make a single request to the origin and recieve data from two different sources.

        p
          | Posting YouTube links to Twitter is not a fantastic experience. On mobile, Twitter clients tend to leave the Twitter app in order play the video. They'll either leave the app entirely, by sending the users to the YouTube app, or they'll show the video in browser view. This bot fixes that.
        p
          | This bot takes the latest hot posts from 
          = reddit_link subreddit: 'youtubehaiku'
          |  and posts them to 
          = twitter_link profile: 'rYouTubeHaiku'
          |  as native Twitter videos. This allows users to view the videos without leaving their clients.
        p
          | The bot is written in NodeJS and runs in an 
          = link_to 'AWS Lambda', 'https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/'
          |  function. It uses 
          = link_to 'IFTTT', 'https://ifttt.com/'
          |  to convert the Reddit feed into call's to an 
          = link_to 'API Gateway', 'https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/'
          |  endpoint. It downloads the YouTube videos using 
          = github_link project: { profile: 'rg3', repo: 'youtube-dl' }
          |  and then uploads them to Twitter's API.
