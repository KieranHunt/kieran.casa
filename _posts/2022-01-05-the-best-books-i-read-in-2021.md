Alone in space. Humanity‚Äôs last ditch effort to save itself. Fans of the Martian will love this. I sure did.

A commentary on social media wrapped in a science fiction novel. John has strong competition.

A vampire book dealing with loneliness and alcoholism. One of my favourites.

A wonderfully nerdy tale about AI/Human relationships. You should read this and then the rest of the series.
