I'm running the [2023 Knynsa Forest half marathon](https://knysnaforestmarathon.co.za/) ([archive](https://archive.ph/Dk0gc)) this year.
This is my first ever half-marathon, so I want to document my training for it.

The following table shows the training plan I'll be following.
It's a modified version of [Hal Higdon's Novice 2 Half Marathon training schedule](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/half-marathon-training/novice-2-half-marathon/) ([archive](https://archive.ph/8PqiF)).
I've modified Hal's schedule by lengthing it to 16 weeks and making the distances more metric-friendly.

## Diary

### 2023-03-21

Day 1!
I almost forgot to run today.
It was a relatively easy one.
Just up to the Molteno reservoir and around a few times.
I'm not planning to slow down my Brazilian Jiu-jitsu training during this half-marathon prep so it'll be interesting to see how one affects the other.
BJJ is always on Monday and Wednesday evenings.
