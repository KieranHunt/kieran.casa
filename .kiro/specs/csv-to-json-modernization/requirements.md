# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves modernizing the existing CSV to JSON converter tool to match the modern React-based architecture used in other tools like RFC6902 and everyit-zone. The current implementation uses vanilla JavaScript with basic HTML elements, while the modernized version should use React with JSX, import maps, ESM.sh dependencies, Radix UI components, and Tailwind CSS styling to provide a more polished and consistent user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Modern React Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the website, I want the CSV to JSON tool to use the same modern React architecture as other tools, so that the codebase is consistent and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tool loads THEN it SHALL use React 18 with JSX syntax
2. WHEN dependencies are loaded THEN they SHALL be imported via ESM.sh using import maps
3. WHEN the component renders THEN it SHALL use React hooks (useState, useCallback, useEffect) for state management
4. WHEN the tool is structured THEN it SHALL follow the same component architecture as RFC6902 and everyit-zone tools

### Requirement 2: Enhanced User Interface with Radix UI

**User Story:** As a user of the CSV to JSON tool, I want a polished interface with proper accessibility and visual feedback, so that I can efficiently convert my data with confidence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I interact with form elements THEN they SHALL use Radix UI Form components for proper validation and accessibility
2. WHEN I hover over interactive elements THEN they SHALL show tooltips using Radix UI Tooltip components
3. WHEN I copy content THEN the copy button SHALL provide visual feedback using Radix UI icons (CopyIcon, CheckIcon)
4. WHEN the interface loads THEN it SHALL use Radix UI Separator components for visual organization
5. WHEN I navigate the interface THEN all interactive elements SHALL be properly accessible with keyboard navigation

### Requirement 3: Drag and Drop File Upload

**User Story:** As a user, I want to drag and drop CSV files onto the input area, so that I can quickly load large CSV files without manually copying and pasting content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I drag a CSV file over the input area THEN the area SHALL provide visual feedback indicating it's a valid drop zone
2. WHEN I drop a CSV file THEN the file content SHALL be automatically loaded into the CSV input textarea
3. WHEN I drop multiple files THEN the system SHALL handle only the first file and provide appropriate feedback
4. WHEN I drop a non-text file THEN the system SHALL show an error message
5. WHEN drag and drop is not supported THEN the manual input method SHALL still work as a fallback

### Requirement 4: CSV Processing and JSON Conversion

**User Story:** As a user, I want to convert CSV data to JSON format with intelligent parsing, so that I can transform my structured data for use in applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I input CSV data THEN the system SHALL parse it using a proper CSV parsing library (csv-parse)
2. WHEN the CSV contains JSON-like strings THEN the system SHALL attempt to parse them as JSON objects
3. WHEN the CSV has headers THEN they SHALL be used as object keys in the resulting JSON
4. WHEN the conversion completes THEN the JSON output SHALL be properly formatted with 2-space indentation
5. WHEN there are parsing errors THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages to the user

### Requirement 5: Copy to Clipboard Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want to easily copy the converted JSON to my clipboard, so that I can use it in other applications without manual selection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click the copy button THEN the JSON output SHALL be copied to my clipboard
2. WHEN the copy succeeds THEN the copy icon SHALL change to a checkmark for visual confirmation
3. WHEN the copy fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback copy methods and error messaging
4. WHEN I copy content THEN screen readers SHALL announce the copy status for accessibility
5. WHEN the copy confirmation shows THEN it SHALL automatically reset after 2 seconds

### Requirement 6: Consistent Styling and Theme

**User Story:** As a user familiar with other tools on the website, I want the CSV to JSON tool to have the same visual design and behavior, so that I have a consistent experience across all tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tool renders THEN it SHALL use the same Tailwind CSS classes and color scheme as RFC6902 tool
2. WHEN I interact with textareas THEN they SHALL have the same styling (slate-800 background, slate-600 borders, etc.)
3. WHEN I see buttons THEN they SHALL match the visual style of other tools with proper hover states
4. WHEN the layout displays THEN it SHALL be responsive and work well on mobile devices
5. WHEN animations occur THEN they SHALL be smooth and match the performance of other tools

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and User Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback when something goes wrong during CSV processing, so that I can understand and fix any issues with my data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CSV parsing fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages about the parsing issue
2. WHEN file upload fails THEN the system SHALL show appropriate error messages
3. WHEN the clipboard copy fails THEN the system SHALL provide alternative copy instructions
4. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be displayed in a consistent error UI matching other tools
5. WHEN errors are resolved THEN the error messages SHALL be automatically cleared

### Requirement 8: Single File Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the website, I want the entire CSV to JSON tool to be contained in a single HTML file, so that it's easy to deploy and maintain without complex build processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tool is implemented THEN all React components SHALL be defined within the single index.html file
2. WHEN dependencies are needed THEN they SHALL be loaded via import maps and ESM.sh URLs
3. WHEN styling is applied THEN it SHALL use inline styles or Tailwind classes without separate CSS files
4. WHEN the tool is deployed THEN it SHALL work as a standalone file without external JavaScript dependencies
5. WHEN the implementation is complete THEN it SHALL follow the same single-file pattern as RFC6902 and everyit-zone tools

### Requirement 9: Comprehensive Testing Scenarios

**User Story:** As a developer implementing the CSV to JSON tool, I want a comprehensive set of test scenarios to validate the implementation, so that I can ensure the tool works correctly across different CSV formats and edge cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the tool THEN I SHALL create test scenarios for basic CSV with headers (name,age,city format)
2. WHEN testing edge cases THEN I SHALL include scenarios for CSV with embedded JSON strings, quoted fields, and special characters
3. WHEN validating robustness THEN I SHALL test scenarios with malformed CSV, empty files, and very large datasets
4. WHEN testing drag and drop THEN I SHALL create scenarios for single file drop, multiple file drop, and invalid file types
5. WHEN verifying functionality THEN I SHALL test each scenario against the implementation to ensure proper behavior
6. WHEN scenarios fail THEN I SHALL document the issues and fix the implementation before proceeding
7. WHEN all scenarios pass THEN I SHALL consider the implementation complete and ready for deployment

### Requirement 10: Performance and Accessibility

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the tool to be fully accessible and performant, so that I can use it effectively regardless of my abilities or device capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use screen readers THEN all interactive elements SHALL have proper ARIA labels and descriptions
2. WHEN I navigate with keyboard THEN all functionality SHALL be accessible via keyboard shortcuts
3. WHEN processing large CSV files THEN the interface SHALL remain responsive
4. WHEN the tool loads THEN it SHALL have proper focus management for keyboard users
5. WHEN content changes THEN screen readers SHALL be notified via appropriate ARIA live regions
