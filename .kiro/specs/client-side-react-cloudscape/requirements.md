# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature introduces client-side React rendering with Radix+Tailwind components to a Jekyll-based website. The implementation will allow JSX to be compiled directly in the browser for simplicity, avoiding the need for a complex build process. The initial implementation will be demonstrated on the rfc6902 page with a "Hello World" Radix component.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to add client-side React rendering to my Jekyll site, so that I can create interactive components without modifying the existing Jekyll build process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a page includes React setup scripts THEN the page SHALL load React, ReactDOM, and Babel for JSX compilation
2. WHEN JSX code is included in a script tag THEN Babel SHALL compile it to JavaScript in the browser
3. WHEN the page loads THEN React components SHALL render without requiring a separate build step
4. IF the existing Jekyll site structure is maintained THEN the new React functionality SHALL not interfere with server-side rendering

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use Radix + Tailwind components in my React implementation, so that it can be consistent with the test of the website.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Tailwdind CSS, and JavaScript are loaded THEN Radix components SHALL be available for use
2. WHEN a Radix component is rendered THEN it SHALL display with proper styling and functionality
3. WHEN multiple Radix components are used THEN they SHALL maintain consistent theming
4. IF Tailwind dependencies are loaded THEN they SHALL not conflict with existing site styles
