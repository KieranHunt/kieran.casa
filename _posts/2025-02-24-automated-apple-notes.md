I have a simple approach to note taking.
Every day I make a new Apple Note.
The note is titled the current date.
ISO 8601 of course.
Today's note is titled {{ page.date | date: "%Y-%m-%d" }}.

I wanted Apple Shortcuts to automate this.
The idea was fairly simple:
- If today's note doesn't exist, create it and then open it.
- If it does exist, open it.

It turns out that Shortcuts is just smart enough to make that happen:

![Shortcut]({{ "/assets/2025-02-24-shortcut.webp" | relative_url }})

I think that counts as an [idempotent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence#Computer_science_meaning) ([archive](https://archive.ph/qRW4e#Computer_science_meaning)) Apple Shortcut... ðŸ¤“
And happily it works on both MacOS and iOS.
